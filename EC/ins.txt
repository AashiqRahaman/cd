🔧 Compile and Run

Edit
gcc epsilon_closure.c -o closure
./closure






🧪 Sample Input:

Edit
Enter number of states: 4
Enter number of transitions: 5
Enter transitions (from to symbol), use 'e' for epsilon:
0 1 e
1 2 e
2 3 a
0 3 e
1 3 b
Enter the state to compute epsilon closure: 0




📤 Output:

Edit
Epsilon closure of state 0: { 0 1 2 3 }
✔️ It followed all epsilon (e) transitions from state 0.
